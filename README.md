Implementation of miscellaneous data structures

The python implementation took about a weekend to put together. Hopefully I get faster over time. 

The C++ implementation has taken twice as much time so far, even though it's second. They say that python is easier to prototype in, while C++ is slow and cumbersome at times, but safer. I am learning that first-hand now. The python code was buggy the entire time I wrote it, and only works because the test cases are not that robust.

On the other hand, the C++ version has compiled into more stable versions (subjectively). The C++ compiler generated errors that the python compiler (transpiler?) would have certainly allowed through. 

I have also learned that C++ is FULL of convenience functions and syntactic sugar. Python also subscribes to the DRY principle, but in a different way - there's a library for everything. There's more to that difference though, which I hope to uncover next.
